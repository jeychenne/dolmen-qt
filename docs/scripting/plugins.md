# Plugins

Dolmen can be extended with plugins, which are written in JSON and Lua. When it starts up, Dolmen loads all plugins which are located
in the system plugin directory or in the user plugin directory. Plugins can be redistributed as ZIP files (the `.zip` extension is compulsory).
To install a plugin, go to `File > Install plugin...` and choose the ZIP file. It will be installed in the current user’s plugin directory.

## Structure of a plugin

To be valid, a plugin must adhere to a number of conventions: if they are not respected, Dolmen will silently ignore the plugin. 
The root directory of the plugin must contain the following:

* a description file, named description.json (compulsory)
* a `Scripts` sub-directory, which contains all your scripts (optional).
* a `Grammars` sub-directory, which contains all your
* a `Resources` sub-directory, which may contain anything (optional).

The description file contains all the information necessary to initialize the plugin. All declarative aspects of the plugin are written in the JSON format 
and must bear the extension `.json`. Scripts are written in Lua and must bear the extension `.lua`.

Here is an example of a basic `description.json` file:

```json
{
	"PluginInfo": {
		"Name": "My first plugin",
		"Version": "0.1",
	},
	
	"Menu": {"Text": "Custom menu", "Actions":
		[
			{"Type": "Action", "Text": "Test script", "Script": "test.lua", "Shortcut": "Ctrl+T"}
		]
	}
}
```

The header `PluginInfo` is the only part that is compulsory. It contains essential information about the plugin. The `Menu` key lets you 
create a custom menu: each menu entry (called "action") is associated with a script which must be located in the `Scripts` sub-directory. 
When you click on an action in the menu, the corresponding script is executed. It is also possible to assign a shortcut to a given action.


## Defining search grammars

If you have devised a coding scheme for your data, Dolmen lets you define a "search grammar". A search grammar is a description of your 
coding scheme which offers a user-friendly interface for querying your data; it tells Dolmen what to look for and how to present the 
information to the user.  Dolmen will automatically load all valid search grammars that are located in the `Grammars` sub-directory of your 
plugin. It will create a submenu in the `Conc` menu, whose name is the name of your plugins. All search grammars will be be available as tabs
in that submenu. 

A search grammar defines a number of fields which can take on a number of values. The user is presented with a number of checkboxes for 
each field, and Dolmen converts the query to the corresponding regular expression, as defined by the grammar. Here is a simple yet realistic 
example, drawn from the PFC project:

```json
{
	"Header" : {
		"Object" : "SearchGrammar",
		"DisplayName": "Schwa",
		"Version": "0.9",
	},

	"Separator": "",
	"FileType": "Annotation",
	"Tier": 2,
	"FieldsPerRow": 2,
	
	"Fields" : [
		
		{"Name": "Schwa", "MatchAll": "[0-2]",
		 "Values": [
			{"Match": "0", "Text": "Absent"},
			{"Match": "1", "Text": "Present"},
			{"Match": "2", "Text": "Uncertain"}, 
		 ]
		},
		
		{"Name": "Position", "MatchAll": "[1-5]", 
		 "Values": [
			{"Match": "1", 	"Text": "monosyllable"},
			{"Match": "2", 	"Text": "initial syllable"},
			{"Match": "3", 	"Text": "median syllable"}
			{"Match": "4", 	"Text": "final syllable"}
			{"Match": "5", 	"Text": "metathesis"}
		 ]
		},
		
		
		{"Name": "Left context", "MatchAll": "[1-5]",
		 "Values": [
		 	{"Match": "1", 	"Text": "vowel"},
			{"Match": "2", 	"Text": "consonant"}
			{"Match": "3", 	"Text": "start of an intonational phrase"}
			{"Match": "4", 	"Text": "uncertain vowel"}
			{"Match": "5", 	"Text": "simplified cluster"}
		 ]		
		},
		
		
		{"Name": "Right context", "MatchAll": "[1-4]",
		 "Values": [
		 	{"Match": "1", "Text": "vowel"},
		 	{"Match": "2", "Text": "consonant"},
		 	{"Match": "3", "Text": "weak prosodic boundary"},
		 	{"Match": "4", "Text": "strong prosodic boundary"}
		 ]
		}	
	]
}
```


We first see a `Header`, which provides information about the file. The field `Object` indicates that the file is a search grammar, the 
`Name` corresponds to the name of the grammar, as it will be seen by the user, and `Version` corresponds to the version of the grammar.

Next, the `Separator` attribute indicates the separator to be used between fields. In this case, it is an empty string, which means that the 
fields are concatenated directly (e.g. `1412`). If the separator was `_`, each field should be separated by this symbol (e.g. `1_4_1_2`). 
Note that although a field may be only one digit (or one character), it does not need to be so; a field can be of any length, provided that it can be described by a regular expression.

Next the `Tier` attribute indicates the tier number in which codings should be searched for. 

The following attribute, `FieldsPerRow`, lets us specify how many fields should be displayed in a row. In our case, since there are 4 fields,
we decide to distribute them across 2 rows containing 2 fields each. 

Finally, the `Fields` attribute contains a list of fields, each of them corresponding to a JSON object. The `Name` attribute provides a descriptive
label for the field. The `MatchAll` attribute is a regular expression that should match all possible values for the field. If a user doesn't check 
any value for a field, this attribute will be used to retrieve all possible values. The `Values` attribute contains a list of value. Each of them 
contains (at least) a `Match` attribute, which is a string corresponding to the value, and a `Text` attribute which is the label that will be displayed
in the user interface for the corresponding value, along with a check box. Note that checking all values has the same effect as leaving all values unchecked.
